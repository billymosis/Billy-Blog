  Created with gatsby starter blog template, and my creativity lol 😂.
  So anyone wants to add content or modify how my blog looks are very welcome.
  
  My plans are:
  <ul>
  <li>Creating website for fun, some Cats picture 🐈</li>
  <li>For education purpose, everyone can learn 👨‍🎓</li>
  <li>Mostly I will create article about how to integerate programming with our work as water resources engineer 🏗💦</li>
  <li>Most of my coverage will be open source software, fuck matlab 📚</li>
  <li>Ayone wants to add feel free to conctact 📞</li>
  </ul>
