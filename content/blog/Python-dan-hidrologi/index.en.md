Hello friends, this blog will focus on open source programming.
Therefore, I will introduce the programming language first before moving on to the next post.

## Select which one?

In the past, when we studied in Water Engineering we were taught Fortran, for thesis we usually switch to a more scientific one, one of it is matlab for hydrological calculations, for example, some use artificial neural networks. Somehow Python was never recognized in college. These three programming languages ​​have their own advantages and disadvantages. Here's my opinion and an example for writing "Hello, world" for each language:

- Fortran

  Was made in 1950 and free! It is very suitable for scientific calculations, the downsides are for scientific, okay, but if for example we are in need of non-scientific things such as raster manipulation, or to install libraries it is a bit of a hassle and the last one is because this is an old programming language, the code maintainer is not active.

  `` fortran
  print *, "Hello, world"
  end
  ``

- Matlab

  For this matlab, because it is a paid application and has a large size, it needs a high-performance computer, I don't like it a bit, but the scientific library is okay.

  `` matlab
  disp ('Hello, world')
  ``

- Python

  And the last one for python is a lot of libraries, easy to install, small size, modern and popular with many people, you can do anything! The following is the syntax for python version 3 okay not 2.

  `` python
  print ("Hello, world")
  ``

## Next!

Henceforth, I will discuss python only, because the author's target is really beginners so start from zero. I am assuming all of them use the Windows operating system. For the next post I will share how to install pyton and jupyter notebooks.
