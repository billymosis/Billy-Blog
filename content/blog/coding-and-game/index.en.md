First of all thanks to my cousin who introduced me to programming language since I was a boy. Back then I understood programming language when my cousin showed me that he could move the ball and animate it. Me who was still in elementary school, was delighted to see a ball moving linearly on the old CRT 2000s PC screen.

I still remember once my cousin used Borland Delphi, maybe I thought it was a programming language, but when I was browsing it was only <abbr title = "Integerated Development Environment"> IDE </abbr>. The language used by borland delphi is Pascal objects. I didn't produce anything when I tried to dig Delphi, I bought a book and I didn't read it lol.

In junior high school, I got to know DoTA from Internet Cafe friend. Everytime school finished I always save my pocket money of 4000 rupiah to rent a 1 hour PC. Semeru Net is located approximately 100 meters from my junior high school. The ages of music played by Dear God - A7x.mp3 lol. The first hero I used while playing DoTA was Yurnero or Juggernaut in DoTA Steam. I Use this Hero because I have finished the campaign in Warcraft III and ORC is my favorite race.

In meantime my friend introduced me to the hilarious custom Warcraft III maps, one of which was a uther party, which always made me laugh. Then it occurred to me how the creator of this map would make a custom map. And finally I got to know the WC3 Map Editor.

WC3 World Editor is an IDE developed by Blizzard for developing Custom Maps. The interface is very simple. In the beginning, I probably just played trees, made mountains, just like that. But I am curious to compare the hero skills in DoTA and the default vanilla warcraft hero skills, very different. It turns out that I created a custom hero skill in DoTA using a script for animation assistance, damage, critical chance, AOE and others. I myself started reading and reading about how to create custom skills. I usually stop by the hiveworkshop and indogamers Forum.

From here I know IF, ELSE, LOOP, FUNCTION, VARIABLE. I also had the chance to create a blog to make this World Editor tutorial at <http://seputar-warcraft.blogspot.com/> last post is at 2011 lol.

So that's my story about how to get to know software development. Thank you for reading till end.
