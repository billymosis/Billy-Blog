Hello this is Billy.
To fill my boredom, I want to write a blog.
This blog will be for education only.

In this blog I will later write about <abbr title = "free and open-source software"> FOSS </abbr>. Somehow using FOSS become a habit ðŸ˜‚. Of course, the FOSS that I discuss mostly in the field of Water Resources Engineering.

Even though HEC-RAS is Free, but it is closed source, there is an open source version of HEC-Ras when it is still using Fortran.

I usually code using python, C #, and VB.NET. And this language is very useful if used everyday especially if you are a solo engineer, Jack of All Trade ðŸ˜‚.

If you are a reader who wants to work with me to create software or do experiments I will be ready as long as it doesn't interfere with my schedule. Because the author is currently working at a state-owned company consulting firm, who else if not VIRAMA KARYA ðŸ¤£.

Lots of funny stories when I worked at here, maybe I can tell you how I got in and what my daily work is like.

I'm sorry if my language is messy, I haven't written a blog for a long time, mostly just counting in Excel, rarely use word and PPT, at least I type just to translate.

Hopefully the knowledge on this blog will be useful for everybody.
please share.
Maybe I will release youTube channel? Who knows lol.
